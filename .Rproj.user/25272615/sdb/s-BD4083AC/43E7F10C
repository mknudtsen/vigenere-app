For the white kitten had\n# been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of\n# an hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it\n# COULDN'T have had any hand in the mischief.\n# \n# The way Dinah washed her children's faces was this: first she held the\n# poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw she\n# rubbed its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and\n# just now, as I said, she was hard at work on the white kitten, which was\n# lying quite still and trying to purr--no doubt feeling that it was all\n# meant for its good.\n# \n# But the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon,\n# and so, while Alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great\n# arm-chair, half talking to herself and half asleep, the kitten had been\n# having a grand game of romps with the ball of worsted Alice had been\n# trying to wind up, and had been rolling it up and down till it had all\n# come undone again; and there it was, spread over the hearth-rug, all\n# knots and tangles, with the kitten running after its own tail in the\n# middle.\n# \n# 'Oh, you wicked little thing!' cried Alice, catching up the kitten, and\n# giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace.\n# 'Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better manners! You OUGHT,\n# Dinah, you know you ought!' she added, looking reproachfully at the old\n# cat, and speaking in as cross a voice as she could manage--and then she\n# scrambled back into the arm-chair, taking the kitten and the worsted\n# with her, and began winding up the ball again. But she didn't get on\n# very fast, as she was talking all the time, sometimes to the kitten, and\n# sometimes to herself. Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to\n# watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one\n# paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help, if it\n# might.\n# \n# 'Do you know what to-morrow is, Kitty?' Alice began. 'You'd have guessed\n# if you'd been up in the window with me--only Dinah was making you tidy,\n# so you couldn't. I was watching the boys getting in sticks for the\n# bonfire--and it wants plenty of sticks, Kitty! Only it got so cold, and\n# it snowed so, they had to leave off. Never mind, Kitty, we'll go and\n# see the bonfire to-morrow.' Here Alice wound two or three turns of the\n# worsted round the kitten's neck, just to see how it would look: this led\n# to a scramble, in which the ball rolled down upon the floor, and yards\n# and yards of it got unwound again.\n# \n# 'Do you know, I was so angry, Kitty,' Alice went on as soon as they were\n# comfortably settled again, 'when I saw all the mischief you had been\n# doing, I was very nearly opening the window, and putting you out into\n# the snow! And you'd have deserved it, you little mischievous darling!\n# What have you got to say for yourself? Now don't interrupt me!' she\n# went on, holding up one finger. 'I'm going to tell you all your faults.\n# Number one: you squeaked twice while Dinah was washing your face this\n# morning. Now you can't deny it, Kitty: I heard you! What's that you\n# say?' (pretending that the kitten was speaking.) 'Her paw went into your\n# eye? Well, that's YOUR fault, for keeping your eyes open--if you'd\n# shut them tight up, it wouldn't have happened. Now don't make any more\n# excuses, but listen! Number two: you pulled Snowdrop away by the tail\n# just as I had put down the saucer of milk before her! What, you were\n# thirsty, were you? How do you know she wasn't thirsty too? Now for\n# number three: you unwound every bit of the worsted while I wasn't\n# looking!\n# \n# 'That's three faults, Kitty, and you've not been punished for any of\n# them yet. You know I'm saving up all your punishments for Wednesday\n# week--Suppose they had saved up all MY punishments!' she went on,\n# talking more to herself than the kitten. 'What WOULD they do at the end\n# of a year? I should be sent to prison, I suppose, when the day came.\n# Or--let me see--suppose each punishment was to be going without a\n# dinner: then, when the miserable day came, I should have to go without\n# fifty dinners at once! Well, I shouldn't mind THAT much! I'd far rather\n# go without them than eat them!\n# \n# 'Do you hear the snow against the window-panes, Kitty? How nice and soft\n# it sounds! Just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside.\n# I wonder if the snow LOVES the trees and fields, that it kisses them so\n# gently? And then it covers them up snug, you know, with a white quilt;\n# and perhaps it says, Go to sleep, darlings, till the summer comes\n# again. And when they wake up in the summer, Kitty, they dress\n# themselves all in green, and dance about--whenever the wind blows--oh,\n# that's very pretty!' cried Alice, dropping the ball of worsted to clap\n# her hands. 'And I do so WISH it was true! I'm sure the woods look sleepy\n# in the autumn, when the leaves are getting brown.\n# \n# 'Kitty, can you play chess? Now, don't smile, my dear, I'm asking it\n# seriously. Because, when we were playing just now, you watched just as\n# if you understood it: and when I said Check! you purred! Well, it WAS\n# a nice check, Kitty, and really I might have won, if it hadn't been for\n# that nasty Knight, that came wiggling down among my pieces. Kitty, dear,\n# let's pretend--' And here I wish I could tell you half the things Alice\n# used to say, beginning with her favourite phrase 'Let's pretend.' She\n# had had quite a long argument with her sister only the day before--all\n# because Alice had begun with 'Let's pretend we're kings and queens;' and\n# her sister, who liked being very exact, had argued that they couldn't,\n# because there were only two of them, and Alice had been reduced at last\n# to say, 'Well, YOU can be one of them then, and I'LL be all the rest.'\n# And once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in\n# her ear, 'Nurse! Do let's pretend that I'm a hungry hyaena, and you're a\n# bone.'\n# \n# But this is taking us away from Alice's speech to the kitten. 'Let's\n# pretend that you're the Red Queen, Kitty! Do you know, I think if you\n# sat up and folded your arms, you'd look exactly like her. Now do try,\n# there's a dear!' And Alice got the Red Queen off the table, and set it\n# up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate: however, the thing\n# didn't succeed, principally, Alice said, because the kitten wouldn't\n# fold its arms properly. So, to punish it, she held it up to the\n# Looking-glass, that it might see how sulky it was--'and if you're not\n# good directly,' she added, 'I'll put you through into Looking-glass\n# House. How would you like THAT?'\"\n\n\n\n",
